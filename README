DESCRIPTION

TwitTornado is a real-time Twitter Client build with FriendFeed/Facebook's new Tornado Framework

There are two significant advantages that Tornado brings to Twitter:

   1. Tweets made on TwitTornado will be sent to other TwitTornado clients instananeously.
   2. There is no need to refresh. Your stream is automatically updated with the other non-TwitTornado tweets in 30 second intervals.

ABOUT

I created Twitbrowse as an exercise to learn Tornado. It is an awesome framework!

I've open sourced the code as an example for others. You can find the source at github. If you make improvements to the functionality or design be sure to make a pull request and I'll update on the live server.



REQUIREMENTS:

  - You need to have Tornado installed.  clone it from github here http://github.com/facebook/tornado

     git clone git://github.com/facebook/tornado.git  

  - You also need to have TwitTornado source.  Clone it from github here http://github.com/godavemon/TwitTornado

     git clone git://github.com/godavemon/TwitTornado.git  


CONFIGURATION:

   You will need to obtain twitter oauth keys for your app from  http://twitter.com/oauth

   Edit the twitter_consumer_key and twitter_consumer_secret variables in twittornado.py with your app's values
   
   You may also want to configure the port variable (default = 80)


RUNNING:

  $ git clone git://github.com/godavemon/TwitTornado.git  
  $ cd TwitTornado
  $ python twittornado.py



Again, if you fork and improve the app make sure to let me know by doing a pull request and I will deploy it to the live site at TwitTornado.com!
